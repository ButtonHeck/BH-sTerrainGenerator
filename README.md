# The sugarpunky chocolate disaster
Development began in February 2018 and is still in progress. This project firstly is a test ground for me to learn OpenGL API, in the very end I expect it to be a town building simulator/economic PvE sandbox strategy. Almost all the code, shaders and most models I have been done myself, but some parts of code I've peeped on LearnOpenGL website of Joey de Vries (https://learnopengl.com/About). The font and some textures were found over the Internet on different resources.

Below are some cute screenshots I've made during the work, so you could see what it all looks like:
