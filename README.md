# The sugarpunky chocolate disaster
Development of this project began in February 2018 and still in process. Despite the fact that this project firstly is a test ground for me to learn OpenGL API, in the very end I expect it to be a town building simulator/economic PvE sandbox strategy. All the code, shaders and models have been done myself, excluding some parts of code that I've peeped on LearnOpenGL website of Joey de Vries (https://learnopengl.com/About). The font and some textures were found over the Internet on different resources, although in future I would like to make my own, if possible.

*For now, resource management is hardcoded to using files on my own laptop's filesystem and the entire project is being developed with Linux on mind, so, if you want to have fun with it, make sure you have your copy of project configured properly on your machine and that you have all the dependencies and frameworks setup(such as GLFW, GLEW, DevIL, ~~FreeType~~, Assimp). Yes, it is ~~fucked up~~ uncomfortable, but again, the project is still in progress, all the OS dependent parts would be done in a future.*

Below are some cute screenshots I've made during the work, so you could see what it all looks like:
